# Mykaela-Coding-Portfolio

For this project I used both CSS and HTML in order to create a website that serves as my working portfolio for future employers to be able to look at and review my work. Some of the challenges that I faced while working on this included trying to work with flexbox and making sure that the media querys lined up properly with their respective devices. <br>
