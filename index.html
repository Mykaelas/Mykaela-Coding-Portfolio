                    My name is Mykaela Saenz and I have a passion for coding.
                    Growing up as a millenial there were a lot of times that 
                    I was able to make a website and format HTML and CSS to
                    make my blogsites look good. As I became an adult I realized
                    that I could make a career out of it and so I joined a coding bootcamp
                    from Rice University to help me further develop my skills.

                    The projects that are linked below are a mix of projects I had completed
                    during the bootcamp as well as solo projects to help me better understand 
                    coding languages such as HTML, CSS, Python, etc.
